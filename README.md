Steps to run the code.

Here I will expain how to run the files in the repository Details regarding different metrics and operations performed on the dataset are present in the project report of this repository.

Clone the repo your local
Create a virtual environment with 'requirments.txt'
Run Auto_Complete_main.ipynb as it is. It will create some pickle files for tokenization and trained model in the current directory.
Run Sentiment_Analysis_main.py. This will create pickel files for sentiment analysis model in the current_directory.
Finally, run Combined_code.py and follow the instructions on screen to perfom either sentiment analysis or autocompletion with speech recognition.
It will detect whatever you say and give you options to perform either of the two.
